# CarbonOffsetter
[Wren](https://www.wren.co/) is a non-profit that is focused on helping users offset their personal carbon footprint through a small set of rigoursely vetted projects around the world. Check them out! Wren released a [JSON REST API](https://www.wren.co/wren-api) that enables users to programatically offset their carbon footprint in real life! It is geeky and awesome that a line of code can translate to real world impact accross the globe, so I had to use it.

This project is a simple Python SDK for interacting with their API. It requires that you enter your own API user token from Wren (sorry I am not generous enough to offset the whole internet's carbon footprint).
